_We know this is the time where we all are driving towards experiencing amazing hackathons, 🚸technical fests, attending conferences, Open source events🏳, finishing off the tasks or projects, but what if you miss a concept🕵️‍♀️, formula or you get confused in a simple process and you have no time to watch the lifelong YouTube videos, 🐳browsing tons of blogs to recall just a single theory?_

>**Hey, don't worry🍿, you are at the right place!**

>>Once a wise man said"🌚A friend in need is a friend indeed!"

>>A cheat sheet is your go-to buddy, a best friend🧸 and a compilation of knowledge.
